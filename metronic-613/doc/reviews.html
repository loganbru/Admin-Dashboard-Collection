						Metronic is an incredible template. Even with purchasing an extended license, the cost savings is immeasurable. The code & CSS is well organized and while it is feature rich, it is not bloated. It was quickly
						integrated into our relatively complex product and had ready-made UX for our many use cases. Where we needed to extend functionality, this system made it incredibly easy. A tremendous job by the Metronic team.

						This is the best template I've ever seen! And believe me I've seen a lot. Metronic has all the components I need all the time. I can move around the components without trouble. Scripts are easy to manage. Tidy and
						clean. Metronic theme is a hero for a back end developer.

						After a year with this template, I decided to rate it. Why? The main reason is the constant update system that keep helping to improve my site all the time.
						If someone ask me why take long time to rate, well I found some issues a year ago that send through some bugs report that they answer me quickly but it take long time to see the changes make happens.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now I'm glad to use this template but I wonder if they could down the price of the extended version sometime because I would like to purchase it a normal price.
						Anyway, you are doing really good job, congratulations.

						This theme has literally everything you could possibly want in a theme. The documentation is AMAZING, the examples are super useful, and it's really easy to pick and choose which plugins you want to include.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are so many options for basically every component of the app and it's easy to switch between them (ex. changing from a compact sidebar to the full sidebar). So far I've saved about 2 days of work and I've only
						had the theme for 15 hours or so....

						This theme is just amazing, as a web developer / application developer this is just a dream come true. If you've ever build a CMS on your own (like I have) .. you know how many hours you spend on just the design
						alone.. when I found the Metronic template .. it was a face palm moment...
						So many examples, so many possibilities .. this is just great, there isn't any better!

						Awesome! I was a little bit frustated, but with a patience, everything is working. Metronic 5.0 is awesome, specially the design, is beautiful. My support was expired, but I receive a help that fixed all issues. As I
						said before: LOOK AT THIS AWESOME VERSION 5.0, OMG!

						This is a truly magnificent admin template, from code through to documentation and support. Excellent work, this endorsement comes from a software architect who has been credited on one of the largest CMS platforms

						There is so much on this theme which deserve a 5 star. As a developer, this theme saves lots of my time. I used to search around the net to see how people style a certain element, but with this theme, all I need is
						to browse the static html pages of the theme to find what I need and grab it from there.
						One of the best investment I made on Themeforest. High recommended.

						My first foray into the world of Administrative/Dashboard Bootstrap templates and I have to confess, the layout of the package in the filesystem was such that I had no problem figuring it out.
					</p>
					<p> Each page is self contained and includes all the CSS, jQuery, and extra components to fully function. Each page is very well documented so it is clear where the header starts/ends, menu starts/ends, content
						starts/ends, footer starts/end. A+++++ WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE :)

						This is by far the cleanest template and the most well structured and the most well thought out design theme I have ever used.
						The codes are up to standard. The css styles are very clean. In fact the cleanest and the most up to standard I have ever seen.
						This is also the easiest template to customize.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have encounter, many templates that looked good but when you started looking under the hood you see nasty stuffs in css and javascript hacks just to put it together.
						I sure am glad that I chose Metronic. Really really clean code to work on. No hacks! It is such a well structured css and javascript piece of artwork.
						The layout designs and design element placements are such a wonder.
					</p>
					<P> The usability of these designs are incredible.
						I am now looking for material design with angular 1 for mobile. Please produce one. I will be your first customer.

			I run a team of 20 product managers, developers, QA and UX resources. Previously we designed everything ourselves.
			For our newest platform we tried out Metronic. I cannot overestimate the impact Metronic has had. It's accelerated
			development 3x and reduced QA issues by 50%. If you add up the reduced need for design time/resources, the increase
			in dev speed and the reduction in QA, it's probably saved us $100,000 on this project alone, and I plan to use
			it for all platforms moving forward.<br/>
			The flexibility of the design has also allowed us to put out a better looking & working platform and reduced my
			headaches by 90%. Thank you KeenThemes!
